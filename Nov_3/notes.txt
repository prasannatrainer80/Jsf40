Delete : Used to delete all or specific records from given table. 

syntax :

What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE 

Truncate can delete all records, where DELETE can delete partial or all records. 

By using delete command you can rollback the records, but by using Truncate you cannot rollback the records. 

How it works, as a database contains 2 files as MDF and Log file

All periodic activities are recorded in Log file (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) once you rollback it cancels all the operations.
