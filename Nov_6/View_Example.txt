Views 

Can we store any select command data in any database object ???

A view is a virtual table, which allows you to store the select command as an object,  A view will not contains any data of its own, only the select command will be stored in that. 

syntax : 

create view view_name
as
   select_command


Example : 

Create view vwEmployData
as
  Select empno,ename,job,sal from Emp;
